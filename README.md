# The_Family_Guy_Website
 This is a practice project.

 So in this project I'm trying to incorporate what I've learnt so far about html and css.
 This project will include multiple html pages and list of those pages are:

 1. home.html
 2. about.html
 3. characters.html
 4. contact.html
 5. peterGriffin.html
 6. loisGriffin.html
 7. chrisGriffin.html

 and others will be added soon...

 It will also contain css files:
 1. griffin.css
 
and others will be added soon...
